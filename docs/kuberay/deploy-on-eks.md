# Deploy RayLLM on Amazon EKS using KubeRay

* Note that this document will be extended to include Ray autoscaling and the deployment of multiple models in the near future.

# Part 1: Set up a Kubernetes cluster on Amazon EKS

## Step 1: Create a Kubernetes cluster on Amazon EKS

Follow the first two steps in this [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-console.html#)
to: (1) Create your Amazon EKS cluster (2) Configure your computer to communicate with your cluster.

## Step 2: Create node groups for the Amazon EKS cluster

You can follow "Step 3: Create nodes" in this [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-console.html#) to create node groups. The following section provides more detailed information.

### Create a CPU node group

Create a CPU node group for all Pods except Ray GPU workers, such as KubeRay operator, Ray head, and CoreDNS Pods.

* Create a CPU node group
  * Instance type: [**m5.xlarge**](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/) (4 vCPU; 16 GB RAM)
  * Disk size: 256 GB
  * Desired size: 1, Min size: 0, Max size: 1

### Create a GPU node group

Create a GPU node group for Ray GPU workers.

* Create a GPU node group
  * Add a Kubernetes taint to prevent CPU Pods from being scheduled on this GPU node group
    * Key: ray.io/node-type, Value: worker, Effect: NoSchedule
  * AMI type: Bottlerocket NVIDIA (BOTTLEROCKET_x86_64_NVIDIA)
  * Instance type: [**g5.12xlarge**](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g5/) (4 GPU; 96 GB GPU Memory; 48 vCPUs; 192 GB RAM)
  * Disk size: 1024 GB
  * Desired size: 1, Min size: 0, Max size: 1

Because this tutorial is for deploying 1 LLM, the maximum size of this GPU node group is 1.
If you want to deploy multiple LLMs in this cluster, you may need to increase the value of the max size.

**Warning: GPU nodes are extremely expensive. Please remember to delete the cluster if you no longer need it.**

## Step 3: Verify the node groups

If you encounter permission issues with `eksctl`, you can navigate to your AWS account's webpage and copy the
credential environment variables, including `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`,
from the "Command line or programmatic access" page.

```sh
eksctl get nodegroup --cluster ${YOUR_EKS_NAME}

# CLUSTER         NODEGROUP       STATUS  CREATED                 MIN SIZE        MAX SIZE        DESIRED CAPACITY        INSTANCE TYPE   IMAGE ID                        ASG NAME                           TYPE
# ${YOUR_EKS_NAME}     cpu-node-group  ACTIVE  2023-06-05T21:31:49Z    0               1               1                       m5.xlarge       AL2_x86_64                      eks-cpu-node-group-...     managed
# ${YOUR_EKS_NAME}     gpu-node-group  ACTIVE  2023-06-05T22:01:44Z    0               1               1                       g5.12xlarge     BOTTLEROCKET_x86_64_NVIDIA      eks-gpu-node-group-...     managed
```

## Step 4: Install the DaemonSet for NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes

If you encounter permission issues with `kubectl`, you can follow "Step 2: Configure your computer to communicate with your cluster"
in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-console.html#).

You can refer to the [Amazon EKS optimized accelerated Amazon Linux AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-ami.html#gpu-ami)
or [NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin) repository for more details.

```sh
# Install the DaemonSet
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/v0.9.0/nvidia-device-plugin.yml

# Verify that your nodes have allocatable GPUs 
kubectl get nodes "-o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,GPU:.status.allocatable.nvidia\.com/gpu"

# Example output:
# NAME                                GPU
# ip-....us-west-2.compute.internal   4
# ip-....us-west-2.compute.internal   <none>
```

# Part 2: Install a KubeRay operator

```sh
# Install both CRDs and KubeRay operator v0.6.0.
helm repo add kuberay https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay-helm/
helm install kuberay-operator kuberay/kuberay-operator --version 0.6.0

# It should be scheduled on the CPU node. If it is not, something is wrong.
```

At this point, you have two options:

1. You can deploy RayLLM manually on a `RayCluster` (Part 3), or
2. You can deploy RayLLM using a [`RayService` custom resource](https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay/guidance/rayservice/) (Part 4).

The first option is more flexible for conducting experiments.
The second option is recommended for production use due to the additional high availability features provided by the `RayService` custom resource, which will manage the underlying `RayCluster`s for you.

# Part 3: Deploy RayLLM on a RayCluster (recommended for experiments)

## Step 1: Create a RayCluster with RayLLM

```sh
# path: docs/kuberay
kubectl apply -f ray-cluster.rayllm-eks.yaml
```

Something is worth noticing:

* The `tolerations` for workers must match the taints on the GPU node group.

    ```yaml
    # Please add the following taints to the GPU node.
    tolerations:
        - key: "ray.io/node-type"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "worker"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
    ```

* Update `rayStartParams.resources` for Ray scheduling. The `OpenAssistant--falcon-7b-sft-top1-696.yaml` file uses both `accelerator_type_cpu` and `accelerator_type_a10`.

    ```yaml
    # Ray head: The Ray head has a Pod resource limit of 2 CPUs.
    rayStartParams:
      resources: '"{\"accelerator_type_cpu\": 2}"'

    # Ray workers: The Ray worker has a Pod resource limit of 48 CPUs and 4 GPUs.
    # `accelerator_type_a10` and `accelerator_type_a100_80g` below are only used for Ray logical-resource scheduling.
    # This does not imply that each worker has 2 A10 GPUs and 2 A100 GPUs.
    rayStartParams:
      resources: '"{\"accelerator_type_cpu\": 48, \"accelerator_type_a10\": 2, \"accelerator_type_a100_80g\": 2}"'
    ```

## Step 2: Deploy an LLM model with RayLLM

```sh
# Step 7.1: Log in to the head Pod
export HEAD_POD=$(kubectl get pods --selector=ray.io/node-type=head -o custom-columns=POD:metadata.name --no-headers)
kubectl exec -it $HEAD_POD -- bash

# Step 7.2: Llama 2 related models require HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN to be set.
# If you don't have one, you can skip this step and deploy other models in Step 7.3.
export HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=${YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN}

# Step 7.3: Deploy an LLM model. You can deploy Falcon-7B if you don't have a Hugging Face Hub token.
# (1) Llama 2 7B
serve run serve_configs/meta-llama--Llama-2-7b-chat-hf.yaml

# Step 7.3: Check the Serve application status
serve status

# Part 4: Deploy RayLLM on a RayService (recommended for production)

## Step 1: Create a RayService with RayLLM

```sh
# path: docs/kuberay
kubectl apply -f ray-service.rayllm-eks.yaml
```

The `spec.rayClusterConfig` in `ray-service.rayllm-eks.yaml` is the same as the `spec` in `ray-cluster.rayllm-eks.yaml`.
The only difference lies in the `serve` port, which is required for both the Ray head and Ray worker Pods in the case of RayService.
Hence, you can refer to Part 3 for more details about how to configure the RayCluster.

> Note: Both `amazon/LightGPT` and `OpenAssistant/falcon-7b-sft-top1-696` should take about 5 minutes to become ready.
If this process takes longer, follow the instructions in [the RayService troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/blob/master/docs/guidance/rayservice-troubleshooting.md) to check the Ray dashboard.

```yaml
serveConfigV2: |
    applications:
    - name: router
      import_path: rayllm.backend:router_application
      route_prefix: /
      args:
        models:
          - ./models/continuous_batching/amazon--LightGPT.yaml
          - ./models/continuous_batching/OpenAssistant--falcon-7b-sft-top1-696.yaml
```

In the YAML file, we use the `serveConfigV2` field to configure two LLM Serve applications, one for LightGPT and one for Falcon-7B.
It's important to note that the `model` argument refers to the path of the LLM model's YAML file, located in the Ray head Pod.

## Step 2: Send a query to both `amazon/LightGPT` and `OpenAssistant/falcon-7b-sft-top1-696`.

```sh
# Step 2.1: Port forward the Kubernetes Serve service.
# Note that the service will be created only when all Serve applications are ready.
kubectl get svc # Check if `rayllm-serve-svc` is created.
kubectl port-forward service/rayllm-serve-svc 8000:8000

# Step 2.2: Check that the models have started running using `serve status`
serve status

# [Example output]
# Connecting to Aviary backend at:  http://localhost:8000/v1
# OpenAssistant/falcon-7b-sft-top1-696
# amazon/LightGPT

# Step 2.3: Send a query to `amazon/LightGPT`.
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "amazon/LightGPT",
    "messages": [

      {"role": "user", "content": "What are the top 5 most popular programming languages?"}
    ],
    "temperature": 0.7
  }'

# [Example output]
# amazon/LightGPT:
# 1. Java
# 2. C++
# 3. JavaScript
# 4. Python
# 5. SQL

# Step 2.4: Send a query to `OpenAssistant/falcon-7b-sft-top1-696`.

# .....
# These rankings can change frequently, so it's important to keep up to date with the latest trends.
```

Check out the RayLLM README to learn more ways to query models, such as with the Python `requests` library or the OpenAI package. Use these techniques to stream responses from the models.

# Part 5: Clean up resources

**Warning: GPU nodes are extremely expensive. Please remember to delete the cluster if you no longer need it.**

```sh
# path: docs/kuberay
# Case 1: RayLLM was deployed on a RayCluster
kubectl delete -f ray-cluster.rayllm-eks.yaml
# Case 2: RayLLM was deployed as a RayService
kubectl delete -f ray-service.rayllm-eks.yaml

# Uninstall the KubeRay operator chart
helm uninstall kuberay-operator

# Delete the Amazon EKS cluster via AWS Web UI
```
