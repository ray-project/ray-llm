# Overview

This is the publicly available set of Docker images for Anyscale/Ray's RayLLM (formerly Aviary) project.

RayLLM is an LLM serving solution that makes it easy to deploy and manage a variety of open source LLMs. It does this by:

- Providing an extensive suite of pre-configured open source LLMs, with defaults that work out of the box.
- Supporting Transformer models hosted on Hugging Face Hub or present on local disk.
- Simplifying the deployment of multiple LLMs within a single unified framework.
- Simplifying the addition of new LLMs to within minutes in most cases.
- Offering unique autoscaling support, including scale-to-zero.
- Fully supporting multi-GPU & multi-node model deployments.
- Offering high performance features like continuous batching, quantization and streaming.
- Providing a REST API that is similar to OpenAI's to make it easy to migrate and cross test them.
