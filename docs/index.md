Aviary is an LLM serving solution that makes it easy to deploy and manage
a variety of open source LLMs. It does this by: 

- Providing an extensive suite of pre-configured open source LLMs, with defaults that work out of the box.
- Supporting Transformer models hosted on [Hugging Face Hub](http://hf.co) or present on local disk.
- Simplifying the deployment of multiple LLMs within a single unified framework.
- Simplifying the addition of new LLMs to within minutes in most cases.
- Offering unique autoscaling support, including scale-to-zero.
- Offering high performance features like continuous batching and streaming.
- Providing a REST API that is similar to OpenAI's to make it easy to migrate and cross test them.

In addition to LLM serving, it also includes a CLI and a web frontend (Aviary Explorer) that you can use to compare the outputs of different models directly, rank them by quality, get a cost and latency estimate, and more. 

Aviary supports continuous batching by integrating with [Hugging Face text-generation-inference (based off Apache 2.0-licensed fork)](https://github.com/Yard1/text-generation-inference) and [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). Continuous batching allows you to get much better throughput and latency than static batching.

Aviary has native support for autoscaling and multi-node deployments thanks to [Ray](https://ray.io) and
[Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html). Aviary can scale to zero and create
new model replicas (each composed of multiple GPU workers) in response to demand. Ray ensures
that the orchestration and resource management is handled automatically. Aviary is able to
support hundreds of replicas and clusters of hundreds of nodes, deployed either in the cloud
or on-prem.

Aviary is built on top of [Ray](https://ray.io) by [Anyscale](https://anyscale.com).
It's an [open source project](https://github.com/ray-project/aviary), which means
that you can deploy it yourself to a cloud service, 
or simply use our [hosted version](http://aviary.anyscale.com/).
If you would like to use a managed version of Aviary specific to your company,
please [reach out to us](mailto:aviary@anyscale.com).

## Deploying Aviary Backend 

The guide below walks you through the steps required for deployment of Aviary Backend.

### Locally

We highly recommend using the official `anyscale/aviary` Docker image to run Aviary Backend. Manually installing Aviary is currently not a supported use-case due to specific dependencies required, some of which are not available on pip.


```shell
cache_dir=${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}

docker run -it --gpus all --shm-size 1g -p 8000:8000 -e HF_HOME=~/data -v $cache_dir:~/data anyscale/aviary:latest bash
# Inside docker container
aviary run --model ~/models/continuous_batching/amazon--LightGPT.yaml
```

### On a Ray Cluster

Aviary uses Ray, meaning it can be deployed on Ray Clusters.

Currently, we only have a guide and pre-configured YAML file for AWS deployments.
**Make sure you have exported your AWS credentials locally.**

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=...
```

Start by cloning this repo to your local machine.

You may need to specify your AWS private key in the `deploy/ray/aviary-cluster.yaml` file.
See [Ray on Cloud VMs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/vms/index.html) page in
Ray documentation for more details.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ray-project/aviary.git
cd aviary

# Start a Ray Cluster (This will take a few minutes to start-up)
ray up deploy/ray/aviary-cluster.yaml
```

#### Connect to your Cluster

```shell
# Connect to the Head node of your Ray Cluster (This will take several minutes to autoscale)
ray attach deploy/ray/aviary-cluster.yaml

# Deploy the LightGPT model. 
aviary run --model ~/models/continuous_batching/amazon--LightGPT.yaml
```

You can deploy any model in the `models` directory of this repo, 
or define your own model YAML file and run that instead.

### On Kubernetes

For Kubernetes deployments, see [Aviary on GKE guide](https://ray-project.github.io/aviary/kuberay/deploy-on-gke/) and [Aviary on EKS guide](https://ray-project.github.io/aviary/kuberay/deploy-on-eks/).

## Query Aviary

Once the Aviary Backend is running, you can install the Aviary Client outside of the Docker container to query the backend.

```shell
pip install "aviary @ git+https://github.com/ray-project/aviary.git"
```

You can query Aviary in many ways. Here we outline 4. 

In all cases start out by doing: 

```shell
export AVIARY_URL="http://localhost:8000/v1"
```

This is because the Aviary is running locally, but you can also access remote Aviary Backends (in which case you would set `AVIARY_URL` to a remote URL). 

### Using curl

You can use curl at the command line to query Aviary: 

```shell
% curl $AVIARY_URL/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "amazon/LightGPT",
    "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "temperature": 0.7
  }'
```
```text
{
"id":"amazon/LightGPT-52dce0d6-0050-4305-88ca-b8f27413847c",
"object":"text_completion",
"created":1691016843,
"model":"amazon/LightGPT",
"choices":[{"message":{
	"role":"assistant","content":"That is a good question. Let me look it up. I think that it‚Äôs equal to 2."},
	"index":0,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":22,"completion_tokens":26,"total_tokens":48}
}
```

### Connecting directly over python

```python
import os
import requests

s = requests.Session()

api_base = os.getenv("AVIARY_URL")
url = f"{api_base}/chat/completions"
body = {
  "model": "amazon/LightGPT",
  "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Say 'test'."}],
  "temperature": 0.7
}

with s.post(url, json=body) as resp:
    print(resp.json())
```

### Using the OpenAI SDK

Aviary uses an OpenAI-compatible API, allowing us to use the OpenAI
SDK to access Aviary backends. To do so, we need to set the `OPENAI_API_BASE` env var. 


```shell
export OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY='not_a_real_key'
```

```python
import openai

# List all models.
models = openai.Model.list()
print(models)

# Note: not all arguments are currently supported and will be ignored by the backend.
chat_completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="amazon/LightGPT",
    messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Say 'test'."}],
    temperature=0.7
)
print(chat_completion)
```

### Using the `aviary` command line

With the Aviary Client installed, run the following commands on your laptop or on the head node of your Ray Cluster.

```shell
# Set to the URL of the Aviary Backend.
export AVIARY_URL="http://localhost:8000"

# List the available models
aviary models
```
```text
amazon/LightGPT
```
```shell
# Query the model
aviary query --model amazon/LightGPT --prompt "How do I make fried rice?"
```
```text
amazon/LightGPT:
To make fried rice, start by heating up some oil in a large pan over medium-high
heat. Once the oil is hot, add your desired amount of vegetables and/or meat to the
pan. Cook until they are lightly browned, stirring occasionally. Add any other
desired ingredients such as eggs, cheese, or sauce to the pan. Finally, stir
everything together and cook for another few minutes until all the ingredients are
cooked through. Serve with your favorite sides and enjoy!
```

# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I add a new model?

The easiest way is to copy the configuration of the existing model's YAML file and modify it. See models/README.md for more details.

## How do I deploy multiple models at once?

You can run multiple models at once by running `aviary run` with multiple `--model` arguments, eg. `aviary run --model MODEL1 --model MODEL2`.

Note that running `aviary run` multiple times will override the previous deployment and _NOT_ append to it.

## My deployment isn't starting/working correctly, how can I debug?

There can be several reasons for the deployment not starting or not working correctly. Here are some things to check:
1. You might have specified an invalid model id.
2. Your model may require resources that are not available on the cluster. A common issue is that the model requires Ray custom resources (eg. `accelerator_type_a10`) in order to be scheduled on the right node type, while your cluster is missing those custom resources. You can either modify the model configuration to remove those custom resources, or better yet, add them to the node configuration of your Ray cluster. You can debug this issue by looking at Ray Autoscaler logs ([monitor.log](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-observability/user-guides/configure-logging.html#system-component-logs)).
3. Your model is a gated Hugging Face model (eg. meta-llama). In that case, you need to set the `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` environment variable cluster-wide. You can do that either in the Ray cluster configuration, or by setting it before running `aviary run`.
4. Your model may be running out of memory. You can usually spot this issue by looking for keywords related to "CUDA", "memory" and "NCCL" in the replica logs or `aviary run` output. In that case, consider reducing the `max_batch_prefill_tokens` and `max_batch_total_tokens` (if applicable). See models/README.md for more infromation on those parameters.

In general,[Ray Dashboard](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/monitoring.html#ray-dashboard) is a useful debugging tool, letting you monitor your Aviary application and access Ray logs.

A good sanity check is deploying the test model in tests/models/. If that works, you know you can deploy _a_ model. 

### How do I write a program that accesses both OpenAI and Aviary backends at the same time? 

The OpenAI `create()` comands allow you to specify the API_KEY and API_BASE. So you can do something like this. 

```python
#Call Aviary running on the local host:
OpenAI.ChatCompletion.create(api_base='http://localhost:8000/v1', api_key='',...)

#Call OpenAI. Set OPENAI_API_KEY to your key and unset OPENAI_API_BASE 
OpenAI.ChatCompletion.create(...)
```
