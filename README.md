# Ray LLM APIs are now upstreamed and moved to Ray Repo

This repository has been archived and is no longer maintained. We have created [`ray.serve.llm`](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/llm/overview.html) and [`ray.data.llm`](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/working-with-llms.html) APIs to simplify deployment of LLMs on top of [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/). These APIs are now directly integrated into Ray and managed by the Ray team. The history of this repository is moved to [archived-master](https://github.com/ray-project/ray-llm/tree/archived-master) branch only for historical context.
